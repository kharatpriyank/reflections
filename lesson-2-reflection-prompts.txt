What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git Creates a sort of project tracking system to track the chenges in that directory of the project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
repository = working directory + (meta data for git to remember history of commits)
It helps us keep track of previous commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
You can make many changes in the working directory simultaneously, but with staging area you can select the changes to commit, instead of commiting
them all at one instance.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
While adding a new feature, or soliving a problem with multiple solutions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It makes intuitive sense when we use diagrams.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
The changes were preserved. To understang better how the flow of the commits properly.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
Automatic Merging : 
	Pros:
		1. Less rework.
		2. WOrks quickly if small changes/no conflict.
	Cons:
		1. Complex ML required for conflicts, almost impossible for now.
Mannual:
	Pros:
		1. Accurate, discussion based result.
	Cons:
		1. Time/effort required.
