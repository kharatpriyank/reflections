When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When a team of people or >1 person is working on the project, each one might work
   on a different feature/aspect simultaneously, from a distant location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want control over my repo, deciding when to make the changes public.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Getting repos that are already published on GitHub with commit history, to your account.Owner knows you are working on something.
			An open source s/w would be an appropriate example.
	Branch: You/Your team are developing a new experimental feature, each member takes different approach.
		The best one/combination of more than 1 branches may be selected.
	Clones: Get a copy of repos with all of it's commit history from local/remote. Just getting a repo to work on you machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
